      "question": "1. Why does OFDM perform better than single-carrier systems in frequency-selective channels?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Each subcarrier experiences flat fading due to reduced bandwidth per subcarrier",
        "b": "All subcarriers experience the same channel response",
        "c": "OFDM avoids multipath fading by using time-domain filtering",
        "d": "Subcarriers do not interfere even in the absence of cyclic prefix"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Subcarrier bandwidth is narrow, resulting in flat fading per subcarrier, which simplifies equalization.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Each subcarrier may experience a different channel gain.",
        "c": "Incorrect. OFDM uses cyclic prefix, not time-domain filtering, to manage multipath.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Cyclic prefix is essential to maintaining orthogonality in multipath conditions."

        "c": "It increases the signal amplitude",
        "d": "It improves phase synchronization"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Timing offset doesn't affect frequency directly.",
        "b": "Correct! Even small timing errors disturb the FFT window, breaking orthogonality and causing ICI.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Timing offset does not change signal amplitude.",

        "c": "Multiple sinusoids may add constructively, leading to high peaks",
        "d": "Frequency offset increases the signal's average power"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. PAPR is unrelated to the specific modulation scheme used.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The cyclic prefix does not influence peak power significantly.",
        "c": "Correct! Constructive interference of subcarriers causes high peaks in time domain.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Frequency offset distorts the signal but doesn't increase average power."

        "d": "It simplifies channel estimation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Symbol duration increases with more subcarriers.",
        "b": "Correct! More subcarriers = lower spacing, which increases Doppler sensitivity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Bandwidth remains constant; SNR is not directly affected.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Channel estimation becomes more complex with more subcarriers."
